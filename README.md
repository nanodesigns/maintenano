## FAQ

### 01. How to change the design?

The default layout is from the plugin's `view.php` (available under `templates/` directory). To override the layout simply copy the file (`view.php`) and create a directory named `maintenano` in your theme directory, and paste the file (file structure would be like: `{your_theme}/maintenano/view.php`). Now change the view however you want.

You can also intercept the template with `maintenano_template` filter hook.

### 02. How to change who can see the site?

When the maintenance mode is active, by default, only the `administrator` (with the capability `manage_options`) can see the site. You can change the capability with the `maintenano_allowed_capability` filter hook.

### 03. How to translate the plugin?

Locales can be placed under any of the following way:

- `WP_LANG_DIR/maintenano/LOCALE.mo`
- `WP_LANG_DIR/plugins/maintenano-LOCALE.mo`

### 04. How to change the footer text?

Fork the plugin and make your own version. Or, you can follow the FAQ#01 and change the text ðŸ˜Š
